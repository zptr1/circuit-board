# circuit board emulator

Semi-abandoned project. I worked on it for a week or two and then never continued, so instead of letting it rot somewhere on my disk I decided to at least upload it to GitHub.

Race condition was such a pain in the ass to fix and there's still some broken stuff (such as shift registers), so good luck to anyone who decides to continue working on this project :p
